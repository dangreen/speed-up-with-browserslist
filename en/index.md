# Speed up with Browserslist

Today we have a large number of different browsers and even more versions of each. Not a long time ago features were added infrequently, but now you can see them added in almost every release. As a result, different versions of browsers have different feature support, not to mention a different level of vendor support.

Developers want to use new features, as they often simplify their lives. Using modern development tools, you can use features before they even get an official vendor support by transpiling and using polyfills. Additionally, these tools guarantee that website will work in all browsers, regardless of a particular feature support. Examples: [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org) for CSS, [Babel](https://babeljs.io) for JavaScript. But you need to understand that using these tools can increases bundle size.

As a result, we have a website that works in any browser, but it loads more slowly. Let me remind you that loading time and fast transitions directly affects UX and popularity o. What can be done with it? In fact, we don’t need to transpile and polyfill absolutely every featury — it’s enough to do this only with those that are not supported by current browsers (or relevant to the audience of your website). For example, promises are supported by every browser, excluding the oldest ones.

## Browserslist

[Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) is a convenient tool for describing target browsers just by using simple queries like following:

```
last 2 years
> 1%
not dead
```

This is an example of `.browserslistrc` file, that requires live browsers over past two years, with more than 1% of users. You can see specific browsers resolution on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/). Learn more about queries syntax [on project page](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).

Already mentioned [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org) and [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) under the hood use Browserslist, and if your project has a Browserslist config, project code will be compiled for these browsers.

At this stage, we can come to the following conclusion: the newer browsers we are targeting, the less bundle size we get. At the same time, we should not forget that in real world not  every single user has the newest browser, and website should be accessible for all users, or at least for the most of them. What can be done under these considerations?

## Browser targeting variants

### 1. Limited targeting

By default, if there is no config in the project, Browserslist will use `defaults` browsers. This query is an alias for `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead`. In general, you can stop on this query, and over time, browsers matching this query will begin support most of current features.

But you can target a considerable number of browsers by following these rules: exclude legacy and unpopular ones, consider more or less relevant versions of browsers. Sounds simple, but actually it's not. You need to carefully balance Browserslist config to cover most of the audience.

### 2. Audience analysis

If your website implies only certain regions support, then you can try using query like `> 5% in US`, which returns suitable browsers based on usage statistics by specified country.

Browserslist family is full of various additional tools, one of them is [Browserslist-GA](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-ga) (there is also [browserslist-adobe-analytics](https://github.com/xeroxinteractive/browserslist-adobe-analytics)), which allows you to export data from analytics service about your users browsers statistics. After that, it becomes possible to use this data in Browserslist config and make queries based on it:

```
> 0.5% in my stats
```

For example, if you can update this data on every deploy, then your website will always be built for current browsers used by your audience.

### 3. Differential resource loading

In March 2019 [Matthias Binens](https://twitter.com/mathias) from Google [proposed](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4432) to add differential script loading (further DSL) to browsers:

```html
<script type="module"
        srcset="2018.mjs 2018, 2019.mjs 2019"
        src="2017.mjs"></script>
<script nomodule src="legacy.js"></script>
```

Until now, his proposal stays only a proposal, and it is unknown whether this will be implemented by vendors or not. But the concept is understandable, and Browserslist family has tools that you can use to implement something similar, one of them is [browserslist-useragent](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent). This tool allows you to check browser’s User-Agent on satisfying your config.

#### Browserslist-useragent

There are already several articles on this topic, here is an example of one — [«Smart Bundling: How To Serve Legacy Code Only To Legacy Browsers»](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/smart-bundling-legacy-code-browsers/). We will briefly go over the implementation. First, you need to configure your build process to output two versions of bundles for new and legacy browsers, for example. Here, Browserslist will help you with its [ability to declare several environments in a configuration file](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#configuring-for-different-environments):

```
[modern]
last 2 versions
last 1 year
not safari 12.1

[legacy]
defaults
```

Next, you need to configure server to send right bundle to user’s browser:

```js
/* … */
import { matchesUA } from 'browserslist-useragent'
/* … */
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    const userAgent = request.get('User-Agent')
    const isModernBrowser = matchesUA(userAgent, {
        env: 'modern',
        allowHigherVersions: true
    })
    const page = isModernBrowser
        ? renderModernPage(request)
        : renderLegacyPage(request)

    response.send(page)
})
```

Thus, website will send lightweight bundle to users with new browsers, resulting faster loading time, while saving accessibility for other users. But, as you can see, this method requires your own server with special logic.

#### Module/nomodule

With browsers support of ES-modules, was found way to implement DSL on client side:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.modern.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="index.legacy.js"></script>
```

This pattern called module/nomodule, and it's based on the fact that legacy browsers without ES-modules support will not handle scripts with type `module`, since this type is unknown to them. So browsers that support ES-modules will load scripts with type `module` and ignore scripts with `nomodule` attribute. Browsers with ES-modules support can be specified by following config:

```
[esm]
edge >= 16
firefox >= 60
chrome >= 61
safari >= 11
opera >= 48
```

Biggest advantage of module/nomodule pattern is that you doesn’t need to own server — everything works completely on client side. Differential stylesheet loading cannot be done this way, but you can implement resource loading using JavaScript:

```js
if ('noModule' in document.createElement('script')) {
    // Modern browsers
} else {
    // Legacy browsers
}
```

One of the disadvantages: this pattern has some [cross-browser problems](https://gist.github.com/jakub-g/5fc11af85a061ca29cc84892f1059fec). Also, browsers supporting ES-modules already have new features with different level of support, for example, [optional chaining operator](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_operators_optional_chaining). With addition of new features, this DSL variation will lose its relevance.

You can read more about module/nomodule pattern in the article [«Modern Script Loading»](https://jasonformat.com/modern-script-loading/). If you are interested in this DSL variant and would like to try it in your project, then you can use Webpack plugin: [webpack-module-nomodule-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-module-nomodule-plugin).

#### Browserslist-useragent-regexp

More recently, another tool was created for Browserslist: [browserslist-useragent-regexp](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp). This tool allows you to get a regular expression from config to check 
browser’s User-Agent. Regular expressions work in any JavaScript runtime, which makes it possible to check browser’s User-Agent not only on server side, but also on client side. Thus, you can implement a working DSL in browser:

```js
// last 2 firefox versions
var modernBrowsers = /Firefox\/(73|74)\.0\.\d+/
var script = document.createElement('script')

script.src = modernBrowsers.test(navigator.userAgent)
    ? 'index.modern.js'
    : 'index.legacy.js'

document.all[1].appendChild(script)
```

Another fact is that generated regexpes are faster than matchesUA function from browserslist-useragent, so it makes sense to use browserslist-useragent-regexp on server side too:

```js
> matchesUA('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0', { browsers: ['Firefox > 53']})
first time: 21.604ms
> matchesUA('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0', { browsers: ['Firefox > 53']})
warm: 1.742ms

> /Firefox\/(5[4-9]|6[0-6])\.0\.\d+/.test('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0')
first time: 0.328ms
> /Firefox\/(5[4-9]|6[0-6])\.0\.\d+/.test('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0')
warm: 0.011ms
```

All in all, this looks very cool, but there should be an easy way to integrate it into project’s building process... And in fact there is!

#### Browserslist Differential Script Loading

[Bdsl-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/bdsl-webpack-plugin) is a Webpack plugin paired with [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) and using [browserslist-useragent-regexp](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp), which helps automate DSL addition to the bundle. Here is an example Webpack config for this plugin usage:

```js
const {
    BdslWebpackPlugin,
    getBrowserslistQueries,
    getBrowserslistEnvList
} = require('bdsl-webpack-plugin')

function createWebpackConfig(env) {
    return {
        name: env,
        /* … */
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: 'babel-loader',
                options: {
                    cacheDirectory: true,
                    presets: [
                        ['@babel/preset-env', {
                            /* … */
                            targets: getBrowserslistQueries({ env })
                        }]
                    ],
                    plugins: [/* … */]
                }
            }]
        },
        plugins: [
            new HtmlWebpackPlugin(/* … */),
            new BdslWebpackPlugin({ env })
        ]
    };
}

module.exports = getBrowserslistEnvList().map(createWebpackConfig)
```

This example exports [several configs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations) to output bundles for each environment from Browserslist config. As an output, we get HTML file with built-in DSL script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
        <script>function dsl(a,s,c,l,i){c=dsld.createElement('script');c.async=a[0];c.src=s;l=a.length;for(i=1;i<l;i++)c.setAttribute(a[i][0],a[i][1]);dslf.appendChild(c)}var dsld=document,dslf=dsld.createDocumentFragment(),dslu=navigator.userAgent,dsla=[[]];if(/Firefox\/(73|74)\.0\.\d+/.test(dslu))dsl(dsla[0],"/index.modern.js")
else dsl(dsla[0],"/index.legacy.js");dsld.all[1].appendChild(dslf)</script>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

In addition to scripts loading, there is support for [styles loading](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/bdsl-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/postcss-preset-env). It is also possible to use this plugin on [server side](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/bdsl-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/SsrBdslWebpackPlugin).

But, unfortunately, there are some nuances that you should know before starting to use bdsl-webpack-plugin: since scripts and styles loading is initialized by JavaScript, they are loaded asynchronously without render being blocked, and etc. For example, in case of scripts — this means inability to use `defer` attribute, and for styles — the necessity to hide page content until styles are fully loaded. You can investigate how to get around these nuances, and other features of this plugin yourself, see [documentation](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/bdsl-webpack-plugin/blob/master/README.md) an [usage examples](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/bdsl-webpack-plugin#examples).

## Dependencies transpilation

Following already read part of the article, we learned several ways of using Browserslist to reduce size of _own_ code of website, but the other part of bundle is its dependencies. In web applications, size of dependencies in the final bundle can take up a significant part.

By default, build process should avoid transpilation of dependencies, otherwise the build will take a lot of time. Also dependencies, utilizing unsupported syntax, are usually distributed already transpiled. In practice, there are three types of packages:

1. with transpiled code;
2. with transpiled code and sources;
3. with code with current syntax only for new browsers.

With the first type, obviously, nothing can be done. The second — you need to configure bundler to work only with sources from package. The third type — in order to make it work (even with not very relevant browsers) you still need to transpile it.

Since there is no common way to make packages with several versions of bundle, I will describe how I suggest to approach this problem: regular transpiled version has `.js` extension, main file is written to `main` field of `package.json` file, while, on the contrary, version of bundle without transpilation has `.babel.js` extension, and main file is written in `raw` field. Here is real example — [Canvg](https://unpkg.com/browse/canvg/) package. But you can do it another way, for example, here is how it's done [in Preact package](https://unpkg.com/browse/preact/) — sources are located in separate folder, and `package.json` has a `source` field.

To make Webpack work with such packages, you need to modify `resolve` config section:

```js
{
    /* … */
    resolve: {
        mainFields: [
            'raw',
            'source',
            'browser',
            'module',
            'main'
        ],
        extensions: [
            '.babel.js',
            '.js',
            '.jsx',
            '.json'
        ]
    }
    /* … */
}
```

This way, we tell Webpack how to lookup files in packages that are used at build time. Then we just need to configure [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader):

```js
{
    /* … */
    test: /\.js$/,
    exclude: _ => /node_modules/.test(_) && !/(node_modules\/some-modern-package)|(\.babel\.js$)/.test(_),
    loader: 'babel-loader'
    /* … */
}
```

The logic is straightforward: we ask to ignore everything from `node_modules`, except specific packages and files with specific extensions.

## Results

I've measured [DevFest Siberia 2019](https://github.com/TrigenSoftware/DevFest-Siberia) website’s bundle size and loading time before and after applying differential loading together with dependencies transpilation:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>

            <td>1,594 ms</td>
            <td>3,409 ms</td>
            <td>8,561 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fastest loading time</td>
            <td>1,143 ms</td>
            <td>3,142 ms</td>
            <td>6,673 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Encoded size</td>
            <td colspan="3">218 kB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Decoded size</td>
            <td colspan="3">806 kB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The result is an decreased loading time and bundle size reduction by ≈20%, [read more detailed report](https://gist.github.com/dangreen/5427c5f2158c357bf0b15d38270508ac).
